## Download

To download and start using the app, [click here](https://github.com/nkhil/london-tube-map-android/blob/main/app/release/london-tube.apk).

You can find instructions on [how to install apps via .apk files on Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+install+android+apps+from+apk+files&oq=how+to+install+android+apps+from+apk+files&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j0i22i30l2j0i390i650l3.475j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8), or better yet, ask ChatGPT.

## Motivation

I'm not an Android developer, but wanted to put together a free app that didn't have any ads or trackers for personal use. Please use this at your own risk.

## Note

The app is a little over 100MB, which I realise is huge for what is essentially a PDF file. I've used [AndroidPdfViewer](https://github.com/barteksc/AndroidPdfViewer) library, which has [this warning](https://github.com/barteksc/AndroidPdfViewer#why-resulting-apk-is-so-big) about why the apk file is fairly large. Currently, I don't have the need to make this app any smaller.
